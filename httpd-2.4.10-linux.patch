+
+1 Overview
+==========
+
+The Apache 2 web server package in Debian supports two types of reverse
+dependencies: modules and web applications. They need to be treated differently
+as their requirements are different. We have special requirements for how to
+declare dependencies against Apache 2 web server packages depending on the type
+of package. Refer to the appropriate parts for extensive information.
+
+Furthermore, there are several helper tools available to assist with common
+tasks. These are outlined in their respective sub sections as well. You should
+use these tools to get maintainer scripts and dependencies right.
+
+This document adopts the normative wording of the Debian Policy Manual ยง1.1[1].
+The words "must", "should", and "may", and the adjectives "required",
+"recommended", and "optional", are used to distinguish the significance of the
+various guidelines in this policy document.
+
+[1] http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-scope.html#s1.1
+
+2 Packaging Modules
+===================
+
+Modules are packages which are installing third party extensions to the Apache 2
+web server which can be loaded at runtime to extend the functionality of the
+core server. Please be aware that such compiled modules make use of a stable
+Application Binary Interface (ABI) and therefore need a recompile if the web
+server changes. Hence be careful how you declare dependencies against the web
+server. You need to make sure it does not break upon upgrades.
+
+A module package providing an Apache module must obey these policies to make
+sure it can be upgraded without breakage of local sites. To achieve this, a
+package must build-depend on apache2-dev. That package provides the 'apxs'
+compile helper which makes sure the module to be compiled is compatible with the
+Apache 2 web server and the C headers the server is providing as a public
+interface. If an updated package is not buildable with Apache 2.2 anymore, the
+apache2-dev build-dependency should be versioned ">> 2.4~", because older
+versions of apache2-threaded-dev did provide apache2-dev.
+
+The resulting binary package should be called libapache2-mod-<modulename> and
+MUST NOT depend on apache2 or apache2-bin. Instead a module package must depend
+on our virtual package providing the module magic number which denotes the ABI
+compatibility version number. The virtual package is called apache2-api-YYYYMMDD
+and is guaranteed to be stable through all binary updates of 2.4.x. The
+dh_apache2 helper assists in getting the dependencies right.
+
+2.1 '.load' and '.conf' files
+-----------------------------
+
+The module must install a 'module.load' file to /etc/apache2/modules-available,
+where 'module' is the name of the installed module minus the "mod_" prefix. The
+'.load' file must contain an appropriate "LoadModule" directive only.
+Additionally maintainers may use a magic line in '.load' files to declare
+module dependencies and conflicts which need to be resolved to load a module for
+a local site. This is useful if a module depends on other modules to be
+loaded, or to conflict with other modules if they can't be loaded at the same
+time. a2enmod and a2dismod will parse any "magic comment lines" with the format
+"# Depends: module [module [...]]" and "# Conflicts: module [module [...]]";
+for example to load mod_foo:
+
+In 'foo.load':
+
+	# Depends: bar
+	# Conflicts: baz
+	LoadModule foo_module /usr/lib/modules/mod_foo.so
+
+
+Additionally, if required, a 'foo.conf' configuration file to configure the
+module may be installed along with the 'load' file, following the same naming
+scheme. This is useful if the module in question requires some initial
+configuration to be useful. No magic comments are recognized in '.conf' files.
+Otherwise they have the same functionality and requirements as configuration
+files (see section 3 below). You should use only directives provided by default
+by our web server configuration or which are provided by your module itelf in a
+supplied '.conf' file.
+
+In some rare cases it can't be avoided that a module depends on an another
+module being loaded already before its own loading process can succeed. The
+module load order is guaranteed to be sorted alphabetically, which could lead to
+problems if the new module to be loaded sorts later. In most cases such
+pre-load dependencies can be avoided upstream - consider filing a bug. If there
+is no way out of this problem, you may want to add a conditional Include in your
+own module file.
+
+Suppose mod_foo relies on mod_bar to be loaded first. You may want to write a
+module 'load' file like this:
+
+	# Depends: bar
+	<IfModule !mod_bar.c>
+		Include mods-enabled/bar.load
+	</IfModule>
+
+	LoadModule foo_module /usr/lib/modules/mod_foo.so
+
+Please note that the bar.load file must also contain a matching "<IfModule
+!mod_bar.c>" guard as it would be loaded twice otherwise. Use this method
+extremely sparingly and in agreement with related package maintainers only.
+Note that such a module '.load' file must still contain a "Depends:" magic line
+to make sure that the a2enmod/a2dismod dependency resolver works correctly.
+
+2.2 Maintainer scripts
+----------------------
+
+Maintainer scripts should not invoke a2enmod directly. Instead, the
+apache2-maintscript-helper should be used. Please be aware that the helper is
+not guaranteed to be installed on the target system. There are certain setups
+which do not require Debian specific configurations, so modules must not do
+anything in maintainer scripts which makes use of Debian-specific enhancements
+like apache2-maintscript-helper, a2enmod, or a2query unconditionally. It is
+recommended to invoke it like this:
+
+        if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
+		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
+		apache2_invoke enmod foo
+	fi
+
+The dh_apache2 helper can be used to install module configuration and load
+files. Additionally it generates appropriate maintainer scripts. The
+apache2-maintscript-helper provides a few functions for common tasks. See their
+respective reference documentations below.
+
+If maintainer scripts use a2enmod/a2dismod manually, they must invoke them with
+the "-m" (maintainer mode) switch.
+
+3 Packaging Sites and Configurations for Web Applications
+=========================================================
+
+Web applications are different from modules in that they do not have a hard
+dependency on the web server. Typically they require a running web server,
+but they do not need to worry about binary compatibility of modules. We accept
+that there are other web servers besides Apache; thus we discourage package
+maintainers of web applications from depending unconditionally on Apache. That
+said, we provide several helpers to assist web application packagers to invoke
+configuration snippets to enable a web application in the Apache 2 web server.
+
+We differentiate between two sub-types: sites and general configuration. Sites
+are installed to /etc/apache2/sites-available and configure a particular
+virtual host. Special care must be taken when installing a site configuration
+to make sure it does not interfere with site-local configuration used by the
+administrator. Typically there are only a few use cases where a Debian
+package should include a virtual host configuration.
+
+The general configuration snippets are installed to /etc/apache2/conf-available
+instead. Package maintainers are advised to avoid "local-" prefixes to
+installed conffiles, and ideally use "packagename.conf" to avoid name clashes.
+This type of configuration must be used when installing a global (i.e. virtual
+host independent) configuration. Usually these configuration snippets will be
+included in the global server context via the conf-enabled directory. However,
+it is planned to allow the administrator to only enable the configuration
+snippets in a selected set of virtual hosts.
+
+Typically a "packagename.conf" should enable a global alias pointing to your web
+application along with a script-dependendent per-script configuration; for
+example:
+
+	Alias /packagename /usr/share/packagename
+
+	<Directory /usr/share/packagename>
+	  ...
+	</Directory>
+
+Please be careful about the directives you are using. Some might be provided by
+modules which are not enabled by default. By default you can unconditionally use
+directives from these modules: mod_access_compat, mod_alias, mod_auth_basic,
+mod_authn_file, mod_authz_host, mod_authz_user, mod_autoindex, mod_deflate,
+mod_dir, mod_env, mod_filter, mod_logio, mod_mime, mod_negotiation,
+mod_setenvif, mod_unixd, mod_version, mod_watchdog. Check the module
+documentation for the modules providing directives you are using.
+
+Note that not all directives are really required. If your <Directory>
+configuration can be enhanced by mod_rewrite rules, but does not necessarily
+need to use them, you could do something like:
+
+	<Directory /usr/share/packagename>
+	  ...
+	  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
+	   RewriteEngine on
+	   RewriteRule ...
+	  </IfModule>
+	</Directory>
+
+(Note that some common uses of mod_rewrite for web applications can be replaced
+by the relatively new FallbackResource directive.)
+
+3.1 Web application module dependencies
+---------------------------------------
+
+There are use cases where a configuration really needs a certain module to be
+enabled. This is tricky to achieve for web applications as dependencies could
+lead to complex dependency chains which could break unrelated web applications
+installed alongside your package. Thus, we do not resolve module dependencies
+for web applications automatically, but they may be expressed (see 'load' files
+in section 2.1), and a2enconf will warn the site administrator about modules
+which need to enabled. Moreover, modules can be arbitrarily enabled and
+disabled by local administrators, so a web application must make sure not to
+break the web server's start-up if a required module is not available.
+
+The syntax for config snippets to express dependencies is identical to the
+syntax in modules' '.load' files.  Within your package.conf file you still need
+to protect non-default directives with <IfModule> clauses as there is no
+guarantee that the modules are actually enabled. It is acceptable if your
+configuration file turns into a no-op as long as it does not break the server
+start-up.
+
+For both types of configuration (configurations and sites), dh_apache2 can be
+used to assist packagers.
+
+3.2 Package dependencies
+------------------------
+
+Web applications must only depend on (or recommend) the apache2 package. Web
+applications must not depend on or recommend the packages apache2-bin or
+apache2-data. Generally, web server dependencies should be declared in the form:
+
+	Depends: apache2 | <alternative web servers you support> | httpd-cgi
+
+Using dh_apache2 assists you to do so, although dh_apache2 declares a weaker
+Recommends relation only. While a consolidated and consistent behavior among web
+applications would be desirable, from Apache's point of view, both alternatives
+are acceptable. If your web application depends on a particular web server module
+you need to depend on that, too. For example, PHP applications might need to
+formulate dependency lines in the form:
+
+	Depends: libapache2-mod-php5 | php5-cgi | php5-fpm
+	Recommends: apache2 | <alternative web servers you support> | httpd-cgi
+
+A with modules, web applications may enable their configuration files in
+maintainer scripts. Use of dh_apache2 is recommended to achieve this. Generally,
+special care should be taken not to use Apache2 Debian helper scripts like
+a2query and a2enmod unconditionally. You can use the apache2-maintscript-helper
+tools provided by the apache2 package for common tasks this way:
+
+        if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
+		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
+		apache2_invoke enconf foo
+	fi
+
+Refer to the reference documentation below to learn how to use
+apache2-maintscript-helper. Do not enable or disable modules in web
+application maintainer scripts; instead protect your configuration with
+<IfModule> clauses if you require non-standard modules.
+
+4 Maintainer Scripts
+====================
+
+Though already discussed briefly in previous sections, here follow some
+clarifications regarding the invocation of wrapper scripts in maintainer scripts
+of modules and web applications.
+
+4.1 Enabling Configurations
+---------------------------
+
+Both modules and web applications should use the apache2-maintscript-helper in
+general. The helper will obey local policies to decide when to enable a piece of
+configuration, to reload the web server, and so on. Moreover, it will remember
+whether a module was activated by the site administrator or a maintainer script.
+Thus, it is particularly important you do not use "a2enmod" and so on directly
+(though a2query is acceptable).
+
+This is a summary of how the apache2-maintscript-helper should be invoked in
+maintainer scripts:
+
+Modules:
+	Unless a maintainer or debconf script verified that no configuration was
+	to be installed at all, e.g. for scripts supporting several web servers,
+	modules should unconditionally call apache2_invoke in their "postinst
+	configure" sections. It will obey site-local policies in future and will
+	make sure that disabled modules are not enabled again during upgrades of
+	a module package.
+
+	Modules need to be disabled on removal (and purge anyway), as otherwise
+	their configuration will be broken (as LoadModule would fail because of
+	the missing shared object file). Thus, modules need to call
+	"apache2_invoke dismod" on both removal and purge. It's apache2_invoke's
+	job to deal with upgrades and it will remember modules it removed during
+	removal and will reenable them during re-install.
+
+Web Applications:
+	Web Applications derive the same behavior as modules if the web
+	application can be run with a sensible out-of-box configuration; don't
+	enable it otherwise. Likewise, web application should also be disabled
+	on removal (and on purge anyway), because important files may be missing
+	(and that's the point of package removal, anyway).
+
+4.2 Switching MPMs
+------------------
+
+Only modules are allowed to switch the enabled MPM. Web applications must not
+switch the enabled MPM in their maintainer scripts. To actually switch the MPM,
+packagers can use a2query to find out whether it is necessary, and if so, can
+switch it by using the corresponding helper function provided in
+apache2-maintscript-helper. Do not try to switch the MPM yourself - the helper
+function takes special care not to leave the site in a state without an enabled
+MPM, which is a fatal error.
+
+
+The helper call may fail. Your maintainer script must cope with this
+possibility. It is not recommended to make your maintainer script fail if the
+MPM could not be changed. Instead emit a warning. You can use the apache2_msg
+function from apache2-maintscript-helper which will also log to syslog. If you
+are using debconf anyway you may want to consider using that - but continue
+operation. However, make sure you only enable the module in question if the MPM
+was changed successfully.  See below for an example snippet:
+
+
+	if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
+		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
+
+		# mod_foo requires the prefork MPM
+		if [ $(a2query -M) != 'prefork' ] ; then
+			if apache2_switch_mpm prefork ; then
+				apache2_invoke enmod foo
+			else
+				apache2_msg err "Could not switch to prefork, not enabling mod_foo"
+			fi
+		else
+			apache2_invoke enmod foo
+		fi
+
+	fi
+
+
+5. Tools
+========
+
+This is an overview of tools supplied with the Apache2 package which can assist
+in building web application and module packages.
+
+5.1 apache2-maintscript-helper
+------------------------------
+
+The apache2-maintscript-helper is a collection of functions which can be
+sourced in maintainer scripts to do required tasks in a simple and
+standardized way. It is NOT a script; it is a library (insofar as shell
+functions can be libraries). This is to avoid users calling these functions.
+They are not meant to be used by users. The helper is installed within the
+apache2 binary package. Thus you MUST NOT use any function of it
+unconditionally, as for both modules and web applications there are use cases
+when this package is not added as a dependency. Thus, use it in a protected
+conditional like this only:
+
+        if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
+		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
+		<call apache2-maintscript-helper specific functions>
+	fi
+
+The helper provides functions to enable and disable configuration files,
+restart the web server, switch the MPM in use and similar. Refer to the source
+code for detailed interface documentation. When available, please use the
+apache2-maintscript-helper instead of calling helper scripts directly, as these
+functions are careful to invoke and use the appropriate helper. Later versions
+may be configurable to allow the administrator to influence which actions are
+performed.
+
+Always check the return code of the called function to find out whether
+something went wrong:
+
+	if ! apache2_invoke enmod modulename ; then
+		echo "Whoops! Something went wrong"
+	fi
+
+5.2 dh_apache2
+--------------
+
+dh_apache2 is a debhelper which can be used to install modules, module
+configuration, site configuration, and global configuration snippets. It assists
+you to set appropriate dependencies and maintainer scripts. Refer to
+dh_apache2(1) for full usage guidelines.
+
+5.2 a2enmod
+-----------
+
+a2enmod and its special invocations a2enconf, a2ensite, a2dismod, a2dissite and
+a2disconf can be used to enable all types of Apache 2 configuration files. When
+invoking these helpers in maintainer scripts, you should carefully check their
+error return codes. These scripts must always be used with the -q (quiet) and -m
+(maintainer mode) switches in maintainer scripts. Preferably, you should not
+interface with this scripts directly; instead it is recommended to use
+apache2-maintscript-helper. For detailed usage refer to their respective man
+pages.
+
+5.3 a2query
+----------
+
+a2query is a query tool to retrieve runtime status information about the Apache
+2 web server instance. You can use this tool to get information about loaded
+modules, the MPM used on the installation site, the module magic number and
+other useful information. Use this script instead of accessing configuration
+files in /etc/apache2 directly as it tries its best to return useful information
+even on incomplete or broken configurations.
+
+For example, you can use a2query to retrieve the MPM enabled on the local site
+and make actions dependent on the result like this:
+
+        [ -x /usr/sbin/a2query ] || exit $?
+        CUR_MPM=$(a2query -M) || exit $?
+	case "$CUR_MPM" in
+		worker)
+		;;
+	...
+	esac
+
+Refer to the a2query(1) man page for the full documentation. Please note that
+the apache2-maintscript-helper can be used to interface with this task as well.

+If apache crashes or freezes, it is helpful if you include a backtrace in the
+bug report.
+
+
+
+In case of a crash, do the following:
+
+1) Install the packages apache2-dbg libapr1-dbg libaprutil1-dbg gdb. 
+
+2) Add "CoreDumpDirectory /var/cache/apache2" to your apache configuration.
+
+3) Execute as root:
+	/etc/init.d/apache2 stop
+	ulimit -c unlimited
+	/etc/init.d/apache2 start
+
+4) Do whatever it takes to reproduce the crash. There should now be the file
+/var/cache/apache2/core .
+
+5) If you use a forking MPM (e.g. mod_prefork), execute:
+
+	gdb /usr/sbin/apache2 /var/cache/apache2/core
+	(gdb) bt full
+	...
+	(gdb) quit
+
+If you use a threaded mpm (mod_worker, mod_event), execute:
+
+	gdb /usr/sbin/apache2 /var/cache/apache2/core
+        (gdb) thread apply all bt full
+	...
+	(gdb) quit
+
+Include the backtrace in the bug report.
+
+6) Undo the change to your configuration, uninstall the debug packages, remove
+/var/cache/apache2/core
+
+
+
+In case of a hanging process, you don't need a core dump and you can skip steps 2 and 3.
+
+4) Reproduce the problem. Get the pid of a hanging process.
+
+5) Start gdb with
+
+	gdb -p pid
+
+and continue as described above. It may also be helpful to include the output of

+Setup
+=====
+
+The scripts apache2ctl, a2enmod, a2ensite, ... and the init script have some
+support for handling multiple instances of apache2 running on the same machine.
+
+The basic idea is to copy /etc/apache2 to /etc/apache2-xxx. An example script
+that demonstrates what else needs to be done can be found in
+/usr/share/doc/apache2/examples/setup-instance. Use with:
+
+	sh /usr/share/doc/apache2/examples/setup-instance xxx
+
+Adjust the configuration in /etc/apache2-xxx, especially the listen ports in
+ports.conf and in the virtual host directives in
+/etc/apache2-xxx/sites-enabled/*.
+
+You can then use a2enmod-xxx, /etc/init.d/apache2-xxx, ... as usual, and they
+will affect the new instance of apache2.
+
+To start the new apache2 instance on boot, use
+- if you use dependency based boot sequence (the default):
+  If you don't have ssl keys with passphrases, you may want to set
+  'X-Interactive: false' in /etc/init.d/apache2-xxx to reduce boot time.
+  Then execute:
+	insserv apache2-xxx
+- otherwise:
+	ln -s ../init.d/apache2-xxx /etc/rc2.d/S80apache2-xxx
+
+To make 'apache2ctl-xxx status' work, you need to set APACHE_STATUSURL in
+/etc/apache2-xxx/envvars.
+
+
+Upgrades
+========
+
+Since only the configuration files in /etc/apache2 are in the package, the
+configuration of other instances won't change if the default configuration
+changes.  Possibly ways to deal with this are:
+
+- Use symlinks to the files in /etc/apache2 where possible instead of copying
+  the files.
+- Don't modify /etc/apache2 at all but use it to track the default
+  configuration. You can then merge the changes into the /etc/apache2-xxx dirs.
+  It may be a good idea to use a version control system for /etc/apache2 to
+  keep track of the changes. See the package etckeeper for keeping the whole
+  /etc dir under version control.
+  An advanced scheme may be for every /etc/apache2* dir to be a separate git
+  repository so that you can easily pull/push changes from one dir to another.
+ 
+
+Package removal
+===============
+
+The Apache 2 package will only remove the default configuration files and
+directories.
+
+
+Configuration
+=============
+
+The init script will try to read /etc/defaults/apache2-xxx. If that does not
+exist, it will use /etc/defaults/apache2 instead.
+
+The following environment variables can be used to influence the scripts.  The
+default apache2 configuration will make use of them, too. Most can be set in
+/etc/apache2-xxx/envvars. Variables set in /etc/apache2-xxx/envvars must be
+exported.
+
+variable		default value

+APACHE_CONFDIR		/etc/apache2         or /etc/apache2-xxx

+=head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+B<a2query>  [S<-m> [I<MODULE>]] [S<-s> [I<SITE>]] [S<-c> [I<CONF>]] [S<-a>] [S<-v>]
+[S<-M>] [S<-d>] [S<-h>]
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+B<a2query> is a program designed to retrieve configuration values from a locally
+available Apache 2 HTTP web server. It was designed to be as robust as possible
+by returning feasible values even if the Apache 2 syntax validator fails.
+
+This program is primarily meant to be used from maintainer scripts.
+
+=head1 OPTIONS
+
+=over 4
+
+=item S<-a>
+
+Returns the Apache 2 "Module Magic Version" (API version) number, the server was
+compiled with. The returned version does not contain any minor versions which
+are known to be compatible with the major version returned.
+
+=item S<-c> [I<CONF>]
+
+Checks whether the configuration I<CONF> is enabled. If no argument was given,
+all enabled configuration files are being returned. I<CONF> is compared by
+string comparison by ignoring a leading "mod_" prefix and possibly a '.conf' or
+'.load' suffix.
+
+=item S<-h>
+
+Displays a brief summary how the program can be called and exits.
+
+=item S<-m> [I<MODULE>]
+
+Checks whether the module I<MODULE> is enabled, The argument is interpreted in
+the same way, as for configuration files queried by the S<-c> switch.
+
+=item S<-M>
+
+Returns the currently enabled Apache 2 MPM (Multi Processing Module).
+
+=item S<-s> [I<SITE>]
+
+Checks whether the module I<SITE> is enabled, The argument is interpreted in
+the same way, as for configuration files queried by the S<-c> switch.
+
+
+=item S<-v>
+
+returns the currently installed Apache 2 HTTP server version
+
+=item S<-q>
+
+suppress any output. This is useful to invoke a2query from another script. This
+is useful if only the return code is of interest.
+
+=back
+
+=head1 EXIT CODES
+
+B<a2query> returns with a zero (S<0>) exit status if the requested operation was
+effectuated successfully and with a non-zero status otherwise. In case of an
+error it leaves with error code S<32> if a requested module, site or
+configuration was not found and S<33> if a module, site or configuration was
+disabled by a maintainer script. However, exit status S<1> is returned if the
+module was not found at all
+

+apache2 (2.4.10-2) unstable; urgency=low
+
+  The default period for which rotated log files are kept has been
+  reduced from one year to 14 days.
+
+ -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Sep 2014 22:25:06 +0200
+
+apache2 (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
+
+  This package introduces a new major release of the Apache HTTP server. It is
+  likely the site configuration needs changes to work with this release.
+  Notable changes which need special care are:
+
+  The module interface (ABI) has changed. If you have any locally compiled
+  modules, you have to re-compile them for apache2 2.4.
+
+  The authorization and authentication system has changed. Existing
+  configurations using deprecated Order/Allow/Deny directives need to be
+  upgraded to the new system. Please review upstream's "Authentication,
+  Authorization and Access Control Howto" [1]. There is a new module
+  "mod_access_compat", which is supposed to provide backward compatibility,
+  but it does not work well in practice.
+
+  Furthermore, MPMs are simple modules now. Thus, the MPM can be changed
+  at any time by (un-)loading a specific module. Be careful when upgrading. An
+  example of changing the MPM is given below:
+
+  a2dismod mpm_worker
+  a2enmod mpm_prefork
+
+  MPM ITK users should be advised, that ITK is not a MPM anymore. Instead, it
+  is a simple Apache module, expanding functionality of the prefork MPM. Thus,
+  users should switch to the prefork MPM and enable ITK as a module. The
+  upgrade scripts ensure this for the upgrade from Debian Wheezy.
+
+  We did change the security model for Apache in our default configuration. We
+  do not allow access to the file system outside /var/www and /usr/share.
+  If you are running virtual hosts or scripts outside these directories, you
+  need to whitelist them in your configuration to grant access through HTTP.
+  Special care must be taken if you are using a sub-directory in /srv to serve
+  your content as recommended by the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS). You must
+  allow access to your served directory explicity in the corresponding virtual
+  host, or by allowing access in apache2.conf as proposed.
+
+  Along the security model, we did also change the default Document Root, files
+  are served from. Previous releases served /var/www by default when no other
+  virtual host matched the request. Starting with this release, we changed the
+  default document root to /var/www/html, so that sensitive files from other
+  virtual hosts wich are typically put into some directory below /var/www are
+  not exposed by the default virtual host. This change further improves the out
+  of box security.
+
+  Moreover, the configuration mechanism in Debian has changed. All
+  configurations in sites-enabled and conf-enabled need a ".conf" suffix now.
+  The latter replaces the deprecated /etc/apache2/conf.d/ directory (which is
+  not supported any more) and works just like {sites,mods}-{available,enabled}
+  via the "a2enconf" tool. The upgrade tries to migrate known configuration
+  files from /etc/apache2/conf.d/ to /etc/apache2/conf-available/ - please
+  review these changes.
+
+  Note this means all existing sites are ignored until they get a ".conf"
+  suffix and are re-enabled by the use of a2ensite. The script in [3] can
+  automate that for simple cases. This change also includes Debian default
+  sites, so the default site has been renamed to 000-default to avoid naming
+  confusions. The rename of the config files to *.conf makes the special
+  handling inside apache2 to ignore *.dpkg-* backup files obsolete. This
+  special handling has been removed.
+
+  Users of mod_authn_dbm should switch to htdbm to manage their DBM user
+  databases. The pure-perl management utility "dbmmanage" was removed as it was
+  outdated and orphaned upstream.
+
+  Packagers are advised to review whether their packages comply with this
+  new version. Please see [2] for detailed documentation and instructions.

+    still works as intended. This is especially important if you have
+    your forward proxy configuration in a different configuration file
+    than proxy.conf.

+
+  * To fix a security vulnerability in the design of the SSL/TLS protocol
+    (CVE-2009-3555), the protocol had to be extended (RFC 5746). By default,
+    session renegotiation is no longer supported with old clients that do not
+    implement this extension. This breaks certain configurations with client
+    certificate authentication. If you still need to support old clients, you
+    may restore the old (insecure) behaviour by uncommenting the
+
+        SSLInsecureRenegotiation on
+
+    line in /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf
+
+  * This release adds and enables mod_reqtimeout, which limits the time
+    Apache waits for a client to send a complete request. This helps to
+    mitigate against certain denial of service attacks. In case of problems
+    with slow clients, the timeout values can be adjusted in
+    /etc/apache2/mods-available/reqtimeout.conf , or the module can be
+    disabled with "a2dismod reqtimeout".

+    and APACHE_LOG_DIR in the default configuration.  If you have modified
+    /etc/apache2/envvars, make sure that these variables are set and exported.

+
+apache2 (2.2.13-2) unstable; urgency=high
+
+  * The new support for TLS Server Name Indication added in 2.2.12 causes
+    Apache to be stricter about certain misconfigurations involving name
+    based SSL virtual hosts. This may result in Apache refusing to start
+    with the logged error message:
+
+        Server should be SSL-aware but has no certificate configured
+        [Hint: SSLCertificateFile]
+
+    Up to 2.2.11, Apache accepted configurations where the necessary SSL
+    configuration statements were included in the first (default)
+    <Virtualhost *:443> block but not in subsequent <Virtualhost *:443>
+    blocks. Starting with 2.2.12, every VirtualHost block used with SSL must
+    contain the SSLEngine, SSLCertificateFile, and SSLCertificateKeyFile
+    directives (SSLCertificateKeyFile is optional in some cases).
+
+    When you encounter the above problem, the output of the command
+
+        egrep -ir '^[^#]*(sslcertificate|sslengine|virtualhost)' \
+            /etc/apache2/*conf* /etc/apache2/*enabled
+
+    may be useful to determine which VirtualHost sections need to be changed.
+
+    Also, formerly accidentially working constructs like
+
+        <VirtualHost *:80 *:443>
+
+    where one virtual host definition is used for both a non-ssl and a ssl
+    virtual host do not work anymore. You can achieve a similar effect with
+
+        <VirtualHost *:80>
+        Include /.../vhost.include
+        </VirtualHost>
+        <VirtualHost *:443>
+        SSLEngine on
+        SSLCertificateFile ...
+        Include /.../vhost.include
+        </VirtualHost>

+
+apache2 (2.2.9-3) unstable; urgency=low
+
+  * The directive "NameVirtualHost *" has been changed to "NameVirtualHost
+    *:80". It has also been moved from sites-available/default to ports.conf.
+    This allows to ship a proper SSL default virtual host config in
+    sites-available/default-ssl, but it means that if you use several name
+    based virtual hosts:
+    
+    - you will have to change <VirtualHost *> to <VirtualHost *:80> in your
+      name based virtual hosts
+
+    - you need to add more NameVirtualHost directives if you use other ports
+      than 80 with name based virtual hosts. You may also have to add these
+      ports to the default virtual host in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
+      (like this: "<VirtualHost *:80 *:81>").
+    
+    If you prefer to revert to the old setup instead (and don't need the
+    default-ssl host), just change "NameVirtualHost *:80" back to
+    "NameVirtualHost *" in ports.conf and "<VirtualHost *:80>" to
+    "<VirtualHost *>" in sites-available/default.
+
+  * For mod_disk_cache, caching is again disabled in disk_cache.conf by
+    default. It usually makes more sense to enable this on a per-virtual host
+    basis.

+    (like the init and logrotate scripts, and apache2ctl).
+    If you have changed these settings from their default values, you need to
+    adjust /etc/apache2/envvars.
+    This also means that starting apache2 with "apache2 -k start" is no longer
+    possible, you have to use /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.

+
+  * The NO_START functionality from /etc/default/apache2 has been removed. If
+    you don't want to start apache2 on boot, rename the S*apache2 start
+    symlinks as usual.
+
+  * To ensure that the disk cache does not grow indefinitely, htcacheclean is
+    now started when mod_disk_cache is enabled. The details can be configured
+    in /etc/default/apache2 .

+
+Apache2 Configuration under Debian GNU/Linux
+============================================
+
+Debian's default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and
+removing modules, virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as
+flexible as possible, in order to make automating the changes and
+administering the server as easy as possible.
+
+Please be aware that this layout is quite different from the standard
+Apache configuration. Due to the use of environment variables, apache2
+needs to be started/stopped with '/etc/init.d/apache2', apachectl, or
+apache2ctl. Calling '/usr/bin/apache2' directly will not work with the
+default configuration. To call apache2 with specific command line
+arguments, just call apache2ctl with the same arguments.
+
+Files and Directories in '/etc/apache2':
+---------------------------------------
+
+apache2.conf
+
+	This is the main configuration file. It does not include any
+	actual configuration we expect to be adapted on your site, so
+	where possible please do not touch it. This file is the
+	foundation stone of the Apache configuration in Debian and should
+	be up to date after upgrades to make sure all configuration pieces
+	are properly included.
+
+	If you want to extend the global configuration, you can customize
+	the Apache web server by including configuration files through the
+	conf-available mechanism. To change listening ports and socket
+	configuration use ports.conf (see below).
+
+ports.conf
+
+	Configuration directives for which ports and IP addresses to
+	listen to.
+
+magic
+
+	Patterns for mod_mime_magic. This is not compatible with the format
+	used by current versions of the file/libmagic packages.
+
+envvars
+
+	This contains environment variables that may be used in the
+	configuration. Some settings, like user and pid file, need to
+	go in here so that other scripts can use them. It can also
+	be used to change some default settings used by apache2ctl,
+	including the ulimit value for the maximum number of open files.
+	The default LANG=C setting is also here, and can be changed to a
+	different language.
+
+conf-available/
+
+	Files in this directory are included in the global server scope by
+	this line in apache2.conf:
+
+	# Include generic snippets of statements
+        IncludeOptional conf-enabled/*.conf
+
+	This is a good place to add additional configuration
+	directives. All configuration snippets need a '.conf' suffix to be
+	included as actual configuration. The local administrator should
+	use file names starting with 'local-' to avoid name clashes with
+	files installed by packages.
+
+	Configuration snippets can be enabled and disabled by using the
+	a2enconf and a2disconf executables. This works similarly to the
+	approach used for modules and sites below.
+
+	Configuration snippets can of course also be included in individual
+	virtual hosts.
+
+conf-enabled/
+
+	Like mods-enabled/ and sites-enabled/, a piece of configuration is
+	enabled by symlinking a file from conf-available/ into this
+	directory. The a2enconf helper is provided to assist this task.
+
+mods-available/
+
+	This directory contains a series of .load and .conf files.
+	The .load files contain the Apache configuration directive
+	necessary to load the module in question.  The corresponding
+	.conf files contain configuration directives necessary to
+	utilize the module in question.
+
+mods-enabled/
+
+	To actually enable a module for Apache2, it is necessary to
+	create a symlink in this directory to the .load (and .conf, if
+	it exists) files associated with the module in
+	mods-available/.  For example:
+
+	cgi.load -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load
+
+	The a2enmod helper can be used to enable a module.
+
+sites-available/
+
+	Like mods-available/, except that it contains configuration
+	directives for different virtual hosts that might be used with
+	apache2.  Note that the hostname doesn't have to correspond
+	exactly with the filename.  '000-default.conf' is the default
+	host which is provided by Debian.
+
+sites-enabled/
+
+	Similar in functionality to mods-enabled/, sites-enabled
+	contains symlinks to sites in sites-available/ that the
+	administrator wishes to enable.
+
+	Apache uses the first VirtualHost that matches the IP/Port
+	as default for named virtual hosts. Therefore the 'default'
+	site should be called '000-default' to make sure it sorts before
+	other sites.
+
+	Example:
+	dedasys.conf -> /etc/apache2/sites-available/dedasys.conf
+
+	The a2ensite helper can be used to enable a site.
+
+The Include directives ignore files with names that do not end with a
+.conf suffix. This behavior has changed from previous releases!
+
+In some cases you may want to enable a specific piece of configuration
+(think of files shipped in conf-available/) for a particular virtual
+host only and not globally as is our default. In such cases you can
+disable the configuration at a global scope for example by doing
+
+	a2disconf some-configuration
+
+Then it can be included in a particular virtual host within a file in
+sites-enabled/. You may want to add
+
+	Include conf-available/some-configuration.conf
+
+in that site configuration. However, be careful, as this may not work for
+some configurations, depending on the context and implications of some
+directives.
+
+
+Tools
+-----
+
+a2enmod and a2dismod are available for enabling and disabling modules utilizing
+the above configuration system.
+
+a2ensite and a2dissite do essentially the same thing as the above tools, but
+for sites rather than modules. Finally a2enconf and a2disconf are the
+corresponding tools for configuration snippets.
+
+a2query is a helper script providing runtime information about the running
+server instance. For example it can be used to query enabled modules, the
+selected MPM, and other information. This tool is primarily meant for package
+maintainers who need to interact with the Apache packages to activate
+their configurations upon package installation, but it can be used by users
+as well.
+
+apxs2 -a/-A is modified to use a2enmod to activate newly installed modules.
+
+
+Using mod_cache_disk
+====================
+
+To ensure that the disk cache does not grow indefinitely, htcacheclean is
+started when mod_cache_disk is enabled. Both daemon and cron (daily) mode
+are supported. The configuration (run mode, cache size, etc.) is in
+'/etc/default/apache2'.
+
+Normally, htcacheclean is automatically started and stopped by
+'/etc/init.d/apache2'. However, if you change the state of mod_cache_disk or
+the configuration of htcacheclean while apache2 is running, you may need to
+manually start/stop htcacheclean with "/etc/init.d/apache2 start-htcacheclean"
+or "/etc/init.d/apache2 stop-htcacheclean".
+
+Note that mod_cache_disk was named mod_disk_cache in versions 2.2 and earlier.
+
+
+SSL
+===
+
+Enabling SSL
+------------
+
+To enable SSL, type (as user root):
+
+	a2ensite default-ssl
+	a2enmod ssl
+
+If you want to use self-signed certificates, you should install the ssl-cert
+package (see below). Otherwise, just adjust the SSLCertificateKeyFile and
+SSLCertificateFile directives in '/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf'
+to point to your SSL certificate. Then restart apache:
+
+	service apache2 restart
+
+The SSL key file should only be readable by root; the certificate file may be
+globally readable. These files are read by the Apache parent process which runs
+as root, and it is therefore not necessary to make the files readable by the
+www-data user.
+
+Creating self-signed certificates
+---------------------------------
+
+If you install the ssl-cert package, a self-signed certificate will be
+automatically created using the hostname currently configured on your computer.
+You can recreate that certificate (e.g. after you have changed '/etc/hosts' or
+DNS to give the correct hostname) as user root with:
+
+	make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite
+
+To create more certificates with different host names, you can use
+
+	make-ssl-cert /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf /path/to/cert-file.crt
+
+This will ask you for the hostname and place both SSL key and certificate in
+the file '/path/to/cert-file.crt'. Use this file with the SSLCertificateFile
+directive in the Apache config (you don't need the SSLCertificateKeyFile in
+this case as it also contains the key). The file '/path/to/cert-file.crt'
+should only be readable by root. A good directory to use for the additional
+certificates/keys is '/etc/ssl/private'.
+
+SSL workaround for MSIE
+-----------------------
+
+The SSL workaround for MS Internet Explorer needs to be added to your SSL
+VirtualHost section (it was previously in ssl.conf but caused keepalive to be
+disabled even for non-SSL connections):
+
+	BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
+		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
+		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
+	BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
+
+The default SSL virtual host in '/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf'
+already contains this workaround.
+
+
+Suexec
+======
+
+Debian ships two version of the suexec helper program required by
+mod_suexec. It is not installed by default, to avoid possible security
+issues. The package apache2-suexec-pristine contains the standard version
+that works only with document root /var/www, userdir suffix public_html,
+and Apache run user www-data. The package apache2-suexec-custom contains a
+customizable version that can be configured with a config file to use
+different settings (like /srv/www as document root). For more information
+see the suexec(8) man page in the apache2-suexec-custom package.
+
+Since apache2-suexec-custom has received less testing and might be slightly
+slower, apache2-suexec is the recommended version unless you need the features
+from apache2-suexec-custom.
+
+Starting with Apache 2.4 both alternatives can be installed at the same
+time and the default suexec mechanism can be picked by using the
+update-alternatives(8) system.
+
+
+Unicode File Name Normalization
+===============================
+
+Using Apache with the document root on a file system that does unicode
+normalization on the filenames can cause security issues. In Debian,
+this affects ZFS with the non-default option to enable filename normalization,
+and HFS+. It is strongly recommended not to use Apache with such file systems.
+More information about this issue can be found by searching the web for
+CVE-2013-0966.
+
+
+Documentation
+=============
+
+The full Apache 2 documentation can be found on the web at
+
+http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/
+
+or, if you have installed the apache2-doc package, in
+
+/usr/share/doc/apache2-doc/manual/
+
+or at
+
+http://localhost/manual/
+
+There is also a wiki that contains useful information:
+
+http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/
+
+Some hints about securing Apache 2 on Debian are available at
+
+http://wiki.debian.org/Apache/Hardening
+
+
+Upgrades
+========
+
+Changes in the Apache packages that require manual configuration adjustments
+are announced in NEWS.Debian. Installing the apt-listchanges package is
+recommended. It will display the relevant NEWS.Debian sections before
+upgrades.
+
+
+Multiple instances
+==================
+
+There is some support for running multiple instances of Apache2 on the same
+machine. See '/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.multiple-instances' for more
+information.
+
+
+Common Problems
+===============
+
+1) Error message "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified 
+domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName" during start
+
+This can usually be ignored but it means that Apache httpd was unable to obtain
+a fully-qualified hostname by doing a reverse lookup on your server's IP
+address. You may want to add the fully-qualified hostname to '/etc/hosts'.
+An alternative is to specify "ServerName 127.0.0.1" in the global server
+context of the configuration, e.g. in
+'/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/local-servername.conf'.
+
+2) Error message "mod_rewrite: could not create rewrite_log_lock"
+
+This probably means that there are some stale SYSV semaphores around. This
+usually happens after apache2 has been killed with kill -9 (SIGKILL). You can
+clean up the semaphores with:
+
+	ipcs -s | grep www-data | awk ' { print $2 } ' | xargs ipcrm sem
+
+3) Message "File does not exist: /etc/apache2/htdocs" in error log
+
+In most cases this means that no matching VirtualHost definition could be
+found for an incoming request. Check that the target IP address/port and the
+name in the Host: header of the request actually match one of the virtual
+hosts.
+
+4) Message "Couldn't create pollset in child; check user or system limits" in
+  error log
+
+On Linux kernels since 2.6.27.8, the value in
+
+    /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances
+
+needs to be larger than
+
+    for prefork/itk  MPM: 2 * MaxClients
+    for worker/event MPM: MaxClients + MaxClients/ThreadsPerChild
+
+It can be set on boot by adding a line like
+
+        fs.epoll.max_user_instances=1024
+
+to '/etc/sysctl.conf'.
+
+There are several other error messages related to creating a pollset that can
+appear for the same reason.
+
+On the other hand, errors about adding to a pollset are related to the setting
+fs.epoll.max_user_watches. On most systems, max_user_watches should be high
+enough by default.
+
+5) Message "Server should be SSL-aware but has no certificate configured" in
+   error log
+
+Since 2.2.12, Apache is stricter about certain misconfigurations concerning
+name based SSL virtual hosts. See NEWS.Debian.gz for more details.
+
+6) Apache does not pass Authorization header to CGI scripts
+
+This is intentional to avoid security holes. If you really want to change it,
+you can use mod_rewrite:
+
+	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} (.*)
+	RewriteRule . - [env=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
+
+7) mod_dav is behaving strangely
+
+In general, if you use mod_dav_fs, you need to disable multiviews and script
+execution for that directory. For example:
+
+    <Directory /var/www/dav>
+        Dav on
+        Options -MultiViews -ExecCGI
+        SetHandler none
+        <IfModule mod_php5.c>
+            php_admin_value engine Off
+        </IfModule>
+    </Directory>
+
+8) Message "apache2: bad user name ${APACHE_RUN_USER}" when starting apache2
+   directly
+
+Use apache2ctl (it accepts all the same options as apache2).
+
+9) A PUT with mod_dav_fs fails with "Unable to PUT new contents for /...
+[403, #0]" even if Apache has permission to write the file.
+
+Apache also needs write permission to the directory containing the file, in
+order to replace it atomically.
+
+10) When starting/reloading Apache, there is the error message
+    "ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted"
+
+If you are running Apache in a vserver environment, the start script may not
+be allowed to set the maximum number of open files. You should adjust
+APACHE_ULIMIT_MAX_FILES in /etc/apache2/envvars to your setup. You can
+disable changing the limits by setting APACHE_ULIMIT_MAX_FILES=true .
+
+
+For Developers
+==============
+
+The Apache 2 web server package provides several helpers to assist
+packagers to interact with the web server for both, build and installation
+time. Please refer to the PACKAGING file in the apache2 package for
+detailed information.

+  * Update doc-base metadata for the apache2-doc package
+  * Changes in the default configuration (not specific modules):
+    + On the head of the apache2.conf configuration file, give a short summary
+      how configuration of the Apache web server works in Debian.
+    + Drop NameVirtualHost entirely. It is deprecated (Closes: #511594)
+    + Remove DefaultType. It is deprecated.
+    + Replace Allow/Deny directives in the default configuration by using the
+      new Require directive. Load mod_access_compat if you rely on the old
+      syntax
+    + Replace LockFile by Mutex which consolidates all lock file
+      synchronization files among modules
+    + Update configuration to use the new IncludeOptional syntax
+    + Enable these modules by default: authz_core authz_host alias cgi dir
+    + Move MPM specific configuration to their respective configuration files.
+      Users can just load and unload MPMs like other modules, enable the worker
+      MPM by default
+    + Move per-site global configuration from conf.d to conf-available and
+      manage it similar to modules and sites. To do so, the new tools
+      "a2enconf" and "a2disconf" are provided. Moreover, such configuration
+      files need  to have a .conf suffix now. The following configuration
+      files are enabled by default: charset localized-error-pages
+      other-vhosts-access-log  security.  These were enabled by default
+      previously, too (Closes: #620347, Closes: #605227).
+      This holds for apache2-doc as well, which is still enabled by default but
+      can be disabled easily anytime by using a2disconf (Closes: #604980).
+    + Give site configuration a .conf suffix, too. For example the default vhost
+      is called default.conf. Moreover, files without .conf suffix are ignored
+      upon startup. Please update your site links and confs. Also rename the
+      default vhost to 000-default.conf and don't do hacky things in a2enmod
+      anymore.
+  * Changes in a2enmod:
+    + Parse "Conflicts: " header to denote conflicts between modules which
+      cannot be loaded into the same Apache server.
+    + Remove dangling "module.conf" files, too. They were forgotten previously
+      if they existed and only the "module.load" file was removed.
+    + Extend the tool to support conf-available/conf-enabled directories (see
+      also configuration changes).
+    + Expect a .conf suffix for sites-enabled/sites-available configurations.
+    + Remove the default vhost special handling. Instead, we expect the default
+      host to be named appropripriately (for example 000-default.conf;
+      Closes: #605535).
+  * The following modules and associated configuration files were removed:
+    + mod_authz_default and mod_authn_default: Please use a proper
+      authentication module instead
+    + mod_mem_cache: Use mod_cache_disk instead
+  * The following modules and associated configuration files are provided (but
+    not enabled by default):
+    access_compat, allowmethods, authz_dbd, cache_disk, data, log_debug, lua
+    proxy_express, proxy_fcgi, proxy_fdpass, proxy_html, ratelimit, reflector
+    remoteip, request, session, session_cookie, session_crypto, session_dbd

+  * Provide a dh_apache2 debhelper which can be used by reverse dependencies to
+    install modules, module configuration files, site configuration files and
+    global configuration files which need to be registered to the Apache web
+    server.
+    Thus, dh_apache2 can be used for Apache web server modules and web

+  * Replace a2{en,dis}{mod,site} by a rewritten version that
+    - supports wildcards (Closes: #373969).
+    - can be influenced with environment variables (Closes: #349716).
+    - checks existing symlinks for correctness (Closes: #409970).
+    - allows to remove dead symlinks (Closes: #480893).
+  * Move suexec suid helper program to a separate package apache2-suexec,
+    which is not installed by default. Provide an alternative version of
+    suexec, which can be customized with a config file. This can be found in
+    the apache2-suexec-custom package. Closes: #312252, #266835
+  * Some more suexec fixes:
+    - Fix race condition when changing directories.
+    - Accept only /var/www/*, and not /var/www*. The same for public_html/*
+      instead of public_html* (CVE-2007-1742).
+    - Raise the minimum userid that suexec may change to from 100 to 1000.
+  * Enable mod_deflate in new installs.
+  * Include config.nice in apache2-src. This hopefully allows apache2-mpm-itk
+    to drop the build-dependency on apache2-prefork-dev.
+  * Mention environment variables in apache2 and apache2ctl man pages and point
+    to README.Debian. (Closes: #475150)
+  * Drop unneeded build-dep on libtool.
+  * Drop obsolete apache2-mpm-perchild package (closes: #477522).

+      o mod_status (CVE-2007-6388)
+      o mod_proxy_balancer's balancer manager (CVE-2007-6421)

+      (CVE-2007-6422).
+    - Fixes mod_proxy URL encoding in error messages (closes: #337325).
+    - Adds explicit charset to the output of various modules to work around
+      possible cross-site scripting flaws affecting web browsers that do not
+      derive the response character set as required by RFC2616. For
+      mod_proxy_ftp there is now the new ProxyFtpDirCharset directive to
+      specify something else than ISO-8859-1 (CVE-2008-0005).
+    - Adds mod_substitute which performs inline response content pattern
+      matching (including regex) and substitution (like mod_line_edit).
+    - Adds "DefaultType none" option.
+    - Adds new "B" option to RewriteRule to suppress URL unescaping.
+    - Adds an "if" directive for mod_include to test whether an URL is
+      accessible, and if so, conditionally display content.
+    - Adds support for mod_ssl to the event MPM.
+  * Move the configuration of User, Group, and PidFile to
+    /etc/apache2/envvars. This makes it easier to use these settings in

+    (inspired by Marc Haber's patch).  (Closes: #349709, #460105, #458085)

+  * Don't ship default files in /var/www, but copy a sample file to
+    /var/www/index.html on new installs. Also remove the now unneeded
+    RedirectMatch line from sites-available/default.

+
+  * New upstream bugfix/security release:
+    - Fixes CAN-2004-0811: Satisfy directive bypass (closes: #273412)
+  * Add '|| true' to a2enmod to stop it from dying when the installed MPM
+    isn't prefork (closes: #273017, #273019, #272865, #273021, #273258)
+  * Touch /var/log/apache2/error.log on new installs to ensure that our log
+    directory isn't removed until the package is purged, so logrotate doesn't
+    complain about its inability to find it (closes: #239571)
+  * Add 032_suexec_is_shared, which makes sure suEXEC is only searched for
+    and enabled when mod_suexec is loaded (closes: #227653)
+  * Use '$APACHE2CTL startssl' consistently in init script to make sure the
+    SSL define doesn't disappear on force-reload (closes: #272531)
+  * Add 033_dbm_read_hash_or_btree to allow apr-util and dbmmanage to open
+    and manipulate DB_BTREE databases, while still defaulting to creating
+    DB_HASH databases as before.  This should clear up incompatibilities
+    with other applications (such as PHP) which default to DB_BTREE.
+  * Moved dbmmanage2 to /usr/bin, instead of /usr/sbin, as it's a user tool.
+  * Added 034_ab2_has_openssl, thanks to 2.1-cvs, Fedora, thom, and a bit
+    of munging, to compile a working ab2 with SSL support (closes: #261820)

+  * Make the default httpd.conf created in apache2-common's postinst contain
+    a fake LoadModule line (commented out), and make apxs2 default to
+    installing modules to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, so people using apxs2

+  * Make apxs2 install modules with mode 644, since 755 makes no sense.
+  * Added a bit of magic to a2{en,dis}site to treat the default site as a
+    special case and add a "000-" priority to the beginning of its symlink.

+    - CAN-2004-0809: mod_dav crash/DoS via NULL pointer dereference

+  * Add some magic to a2enmod to map cgi to cgid if using a threaded MPM.

+  * Drop the :80 from the default site config, so changing ports in

+  * Added 029_docroot_manual.patch, which corrects the links in the start
+    page to point to /manual/ instead of manual/, so the link actually
+    works when apache2-doc is installed (closes: #232954)
+  * Add a postrm to apache2-common, implementing a policy-compliant purge

+  * Add 030_www-browser_apachectl.patch, and make apache2-common depend

+  * Move apache2's (re)start from the apache2-common postinst to the MPM
+    postinsts, so we're not trying to start the old binary if apache2-common
+    is configured before apache2-mpm-* is unpacked (closes: #268936)

+      which can be triggered by an aborted connection.
+    - CAN-2004-0751 is a potential segfault in the SSL input filter which

+  * Changed the ownership of /var/cache/apache2 to allow mod_proxy to

+      with no fallback even if the current kernel doesn't support it.
+    - Add note to README.Debian noting that while we can now read, write, and

+  * debian/config-mods/auth_dbm.load:
+    - New file, in line with introducing mod_auth_dbm; thanks again to David
+      Kimdon.
+  * debian/a2-scripts/a2{en,dis}mod:
+    - Rewritten to be much cleaner and cool. (Thanks to Ben Collins for
+      pointing out that the permissions were screwed).
+  * debian/apache2.postinst:
+    - New file, no #DEBHELPER# token so that we don't care if postinst fails;
+      this way it won't bail if you're already running another web server.
+      Thanks to David Kimdon for pointing out an error.
+  * debian/vhost-base/{enable,disable}.d/apache2:
+    - Fixed! Woot! The code isn't the best you'll see, but now *WORKS*. Whoo!
+  * debian/control:
+    - Extend libapr-dev's Depends to include libapr0 (duh).
+    - Remove apache2-modules-dev as modules are no longer built both shared
+      and static, IMHO this was quite braindead behavior. Upstream's change,
+      not mine.
+    - Remove apache2-support as apxs2 requred apache2 anyway. Chalk one (more)
+      down for "failed experiments".
+    - Removed redundant libssl0.9.6 and libxmltok1 build-deps; we already
+      build-depped on the relevant -dev packages; thanks Ben Collins.
+  * debian/rules:
+    - Modules are no longer built statically as well as dynamically (upstream
+      change), so stop trying to move the files around.
+    - Sort out the libapr0/libapr-dev mess once and for all; thanks to Matt
+      Wilcox and Ben Collins for patiently talking me through it.
+    - Move *contents* of mods-available to apache2-modules, but keep the
+      directory itself as part of apache2, to keep the addons happy; thanks
+      David Kimdon.
+    - s/apache2-support/apache2/, see debian/control entry.
+    - Remove extraneous LICENSE file from the vhost manual.
+    - Remove *.exp files, because they're unneeded.
+  * debian/apache2.docs:
+    - Remove KEYS from the list of docs because this is crap and no longer
+      distributed. w00t!

+
+  * Resync with HEAD (another coming to fix segfaults, but no net connectivity
+    at the moment - 4-11-2001, 2:12pm. Grrr).
+  * New patches:
+    - 011_mod_autoindex-symlink: make icons for symlinks to files and dirs 
+                                 special cases.
+      + Touches modules/generators/mod_autoindex.c
+      + Special cases: ^^SYMDIR^^ and ^^SYMLINK^^.
+    - 012_debian_version: adds "Debian" to the Apache version string.
+      + Touches include/ap_release.h - this patch has *no* context. Please
+        don't give it any, I don't want to have to rediff every version.
+  * debian/config/httpd.conf, debian/config/apache2.conf:
+    - Move main config file to apache2.conf, made it much more bare-bones.
+      + User (or package) config should be done in httpd.conf.
+  * apache2.conf:
+    - s/Port/Listen/ - booya! Finally they cleaned it up.
+    - Add (commented-out) icon entries for ^^SYMDIR^^ and ^^SYMLINK^^.
+      Anyone volunteer to create icons?
+  * debian/apache2.postinst:
+    - Minor cleanups.
+    - And later: Made it just call ap2addhost --default. (and a2enhost).
+  * debian/config/modules/ssl.conf, debian/config/sites/default-443:
+    - Put only generic SSL stuff in ssl.conf, split SSL support out into
+      a new virtual host thingy in accordance with dealing with ports.
+  * debian/config/sites/default, debian/config/sites/default-443,
+    debian/patches/004b_debian_layout:
+    - Add a new alias /cgi-pub/ to /usr/lib/cgi-bin. Packages should put
+      scripts here.
+  * debian/control: 
+    - changed the Suggests: on apache2-doc to a Recommends:
+      + otherwise /manual/ will be a broken alias, as it points to 
+        /usr/share/doc/apache2-doc/manual.
+    - changed libapr-dev to Architecture: all (from Arch: any) - whoops.
+  * Added support for multiple ports on the one virtual host. At the moment
+    it's one gigantic, ugly, kludge. *sigh*. Format:
+    - /var/vhosts/site.name/htdocs-PORT
+    - /var/vhosts/site.name/logs/(access|error).log-PORT
+    - /var/vhosts/site.name/cgi-bin-PORT
+  * debian/apache2.postinst, debian/config/sites/default, etc:
+    - s#/var/www#/var/vhosts#;
+    - s#htdocs#htdocs-$PORT#;
+  * More Debconfage - it now asks if you want SSL support in the default
+    virtual host, and which port number you want (default 81 so it sits
+    side-by-side with apache).
+  * Major change to postinst, a2addhost, et al:
+    - It's all now done in Perl, and postinst is no longer a special case.
+      The standalones call Debconf for what they need to do, calling it as a
+      standalone. This way, postinst just calls a2addhost, etc, and it also
+      smooths the path for me to do the vhost-base stuff.
+  * No, this migration path probably won't be smooth (between apache2
+    versions). Sorry.
+  * Last release before I make it vhost-base compliant.

+
+  * More CVS resyncing joy.
+  * Silly stupid evil poo bum hack to apachectl. I don't like this.
+    Please, help.
+  * Got rid of a few lintian warnings.
+  * Install build stuff to /etc/apache2/build, adjust apxs accordingly.
+  * Agreed on policy with madduck. This is a MAJOR CHANGE, people.
+    A lot of stuff has changed around, so you'll need to change your
+    packages.
+    apache2 now treats everything as a virtual host (even when you only
+    have one host). This allows us to skirt around FHS and do our own
+    thing. ("Thpthpthpthpthpthpt, we're using vhosts. FHS doesn't say
+    anything about that.")
+    Please see README.Debian for more details.
+  * More fun with virtual hosts. Migrated their configuration files to
+    /etc/apache2/virtuals/<name>. This will allow for easy adding and
+    removal, via the new tools /usr/sbin/ap2(add|del)vh.
+    apache2's postinst touches /etc/apache2/POSTINST_CONFED, and will refuse
+    to re-run the postinst config stuff if it's there already.
+  * Module fun - /usr/sbin/ap2mod(en|dis). Modules put their loading line in
+    /etc/apache2/modules/foo.load, config in /etc/apache2/modules/foo.conf.
+    Enabled module stuff gets symlinked into /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.
+  * Move APR stuff to /usr/lib, not /usr/lib/libapr. Whoops, should've done
+    this a *long* *time* *ago*.
+  * More silly APR hacks: Move /usr/include/libapr to /usr/include/apache2, as
+    silly things like php4 don't get the fact that APR and apache2 can indeed
+    have different include directories. Grrr.
+  * Juggled script names - it's now a2(en|dis)(host|mod).
+  * I don't care, I'm uploading. No, really (closes: #103471).

+# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
+# possible.
+
+# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
+# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
+#

+#	|-- apache2.conf

+# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
+#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
+#   web server.
+#
+# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is
+#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be
+#   customized anytime.
+#
+# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/
+#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,
+#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,
+#   respectively.
+#
+#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their
+#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our
+#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See
+#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
+#
+# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in
+#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with
+#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not

+# Customizable error responses come in three flavors:
+# 1) plain text
+# 2) local redirects
+# 3) external redirects
+#
+# Some examples:
+#ErrorDocument 500 "The server made a boo boo."
+#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
+#ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl"
+#ErrorDocument 402 http://www.example.com/subscription_info.html
+#
+
+#
+# Putting this all together, we can internationalize error responses.
+#
+# We use Alias to redirect any /error/HTTP_<error>.html.var response to
+# our collection of by-error message multi-language collections.  We use
+# includes to substitute the appropriate text.
+#
+# You can modify the messages' appearance without changing any of the
+# default HTTP_<error>.html.var files by adding the line:
+#
+#Alias /error/include/ "/your/include/path/"
+#
+# which allows you to create your own set of files by starting with the
+# /usr/share/apache2/error/include/ files and copying them to /your/include/path/,
+# even on a per-VirtualHost basis.  If you include the Alias in the global server
+# context, is has to come _before_ the 'Alias /error/ ...' line.
+#
+# The default include files will display your Apache version number and your
+# ServerAdmin email address regardless of the setting of ServerSignature.
+#
+# WARNING: The configuration below will NOT work out of the box if you have a
+#		  SetHandler directive in a <Location /> context somewhere. Adding
+#		  the following three lines AFTER the <Location /> context should
+#		  make it work in most cases:
+#		  <Location /error/>
+#			 SetHandler none
+#		  </Location>
+#

+	# file in a language the user can understand.
+	#
+	# Specify a default language. This means that all data

+	# Note 1: The suffix does not have to be the same as the language

+		#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:

+		#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
+		#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
+		#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
+		#	 This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
+		#	 SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
+		#	 the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
+		#	 this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
+		#	 mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
+		#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
+		#	 This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
+		#	 SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
+		#	 alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
+		#	 practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
+		#	 this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
+		#	 works correctly.
+		#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
+		#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
+		#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
+		#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
+		#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
+		#   "force-response-1.0" for this.

+ - Memory allocation is done through the Apache API's apr_pool_t structure.
+ - All functions have had necessary Apache API request or server
+   structures passed to them where necessary to call other Apache API
+   routines.  (i.e. usually for logging, files, or memory allocation in
+   itself or a called function.)
+ - struct magic has been converted from an array to a single-ended linked
+   list because it only grows one record at a time, it's only accessed
+   sequentially, and the Apache API has no equivalent of realloc().
+ - Functions have been changed to get their parameters from the server
+   configuration instead of globals.  (It should be reentrant now but has
+   not been tested in a threaded environment.)
+ - Places where it used to print results to stdout now saves them in a
+   list where they're used to set the MIME type in the Apache request
+   record.

+# Parameters:
+#	priority
+#		The message priority. Recognized values are the same as defined
+#		by syslog(3), thus: one among debug, info, notice, warning,
+#		err, crit, alert, emerg.
+#		If no known priority is recognized, the priority is set to
+#		"warning".
+#	message
+#		The message as a string. It is printed out verbatim.
+# Behavior:
+#	No message is displayed if APACHE2_MAINTSCRIPT_HELPER_QUIET is defined
+# Returns:
+#	this function always returns 0
+# Since: 2.4.1-3

+=head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+B<dh_apache2> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--conditional>>=I<expression>] [B<--error-handler=>I<function>] [B<-n>|B<--noscripts>]
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+B<dh_apache2> is a debhelper program that is responsible for correctly installing
+Apache2 configuration snippets and setting postinst, prerm and dependencies in
+Apache2 web server modules and web applications.
+
+It supports the following configuration types
+
+=over 4
+
+=item *
+Apache2 modules
+
+=item *
+Apache2 configuration snippets for web applications
+
+=item *
+Apache2 sites
+
+=back
+
+B<dh_apache2> supports two modes: A limited auto-configuration heuristic or
+alternatively a configuration file driven approach. If a file named
+debian/package.apache2 exists, actual actions are determined by that file.
+
+=head1 OPERATION MODES
+
+B<dh_apache2> can be used in two modes: A configuration file driven approach and
+a heuristic approach. The configuration driven mode is fully documented in the
+B<FILES> section below. This mode is activated by supplying a L<debhelper(7)>
+configuration file (e.g. debian/I<package>.apache2).
+
+The alternative is a heuristic mode, in which no files are installed through
+B<dh_apache2>. Instead the helper will scan the package installation directory
+for recognized files and guess their purpose depending on their installation
+path in the file system. Use with caution.
+
+=head1 INVOKATION
+
+B<dh_apache2> is not part of debhelper and might require information available
+in the apache2-dev package. Packages making use of B<dh_apache2> should declare
+a build-dependency against the virtual B<dh-apache2> package.
+
+B<dh_apache2> supports both, called directly from a debian/rules file or as
+L<dh(1)> addon. In the former case the helper should run after L<dh_install(1)>
+or their respective counter parts in local implementations at earliest.
+Alternatively it can be used as L<dh> addon by invoking it with
+
+  %:
+     dh $@ --with apache2
+
+=head1 FILES
+
+=over 4
+
+=item debian/I<package>.apache2
+
+=item debian/apache2
+
+=back
+
+Lists files to be registered with the Apache 2 HTTP server. The file is
+interpreted as line separated list of installation stanzas, where each entry
+consists of whitespace separated values conforming to the file semantics below.
+
+=head2 FILE SEMANTICS
+
+Each line consists of a triple
+
+I<type> I<file> [I<arguments>]
+
+where the values are interpreted as follows:
+
+
+=head3 I<type>
+
+Denotes the type of file to be installed. Recognized values are B<conf>
+for Apache2 global configuration snippets, B<site> for virtual host
+configurations and B<mod> for Apache2 modules.
+
+=head3 I<file>
+
+Is interpreted as existing file name within the source package. No path
+expansion is effectuated. Just like L<dh_install(1)>, B<dh_apache2> can not
+rename files.
+
+=head3 I<arguments>
+
+Is inrerpreted as optional arguments if any, currently used by B<conf>
+stanzas only
+
+=head2 GLOBAL CONFIGURATION FILES
+
+Global configuration files (determined by the B<conf> type) must have a I<.conf>
+suffix and are installed to I</etc/apache2/conf-available>. Moreover, the
+configuration is activated in the maintainer script at installation time.
+
+Such global configuration snippets are supposed to be used by web applications.
+Such stanzas accept an optional third I<arguments> which is interpreted as
+dependency line of alternative web servers the package supports. See I<EXAMPLES>
+below.
+
+B<dh_apache2> will set dependencies in B<${misc:Recommends}> accordingly when
+this type of configuration is found. Alternatives from the optional I<argument>
+is incorporated into this dependency line.
+
+=head2 SITE CONFIGURATION FILES
+
+Site configuration files (determined by the B<site> type) must have a I<.conf>
+suffix and are installed to I</etc/apache2/sites-available>. Moreover, the
+configuration is activated in the maintainer script at installation time.
+
+Such global configuration snippets are supposed to be used by web applications
+and third party packages which install virtual host configurations. This type of
+configuration sets the same dependencies as configuration files.
+
+=head2 MODULES
+
+Modules are handled specially and are determined by the B<mod> type. Modules can
+either have a I<.conf> or I<.load> suffix. In that case the file is interpreted
+as module load file or module configuration file respectively and is nstalled to
+I</etc/apache2/mods-available>. If the file is ending with a I<.so> suffix it is
+interpreted as actual module shared object and is installed to the Apache module
+directory. Moreover, if a I<.load> file is installed the configuration is
+activated in the maintainer script at installation time.
+
+A typical module configuration has two lines, one for the I<.load> file, and one
+for the I<.so> file, albeit the latter could be installed by upstream's
+makefile, too.
+
+B<dh_apache2> will set dependencies in B<${misc:Depends}> accordingly when
+this type of configuration is found.
+
+=head1 OPTIONS
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B<--error-handler=>I<function>
+
+Call the named shell I<function> if running the maintainer script fails. The
+function should be provided in the F<prerm> and F<postinst> scripts, before the
+B<#DEBHELPER#> token.
+
+=item S<B<--conditional>>=I<function>
+
+Only execute maintainer scripts if the named shell I<function> evaluates to a
+true value at installation time. This is useful to web applications which want
+to install Apache configuration files depending on a user input, for example if
+they interface to the user through L<debconf(1)>.
+
+The defaults is to always execute the scripts. The named function should be
+provided in the F<prerm>, F<postrm> and F<postinst> scripts, before the
+B<#DEBHELPER#> token.
+
+=item S<B<--restart>> S<B<-r>>
+
+In maintainer scripts, do not try to reload the web server, but restart it.
+Otherwise the default action is used, which means global configuration and
+sites make the web server to be reloaded on success, modules are restarted.
+
+=item B<-e>, B<--noenable>
+
+Install maintainer scripts accordingly, but do not enable the scripts or
+configuration by default.
+
+=item B<-n>, B<--noscripts>
+
+Do not modify F<postinst>/F<postrm>/F<prerm> maintainer scripts.
+
+
+=back
+
+=head1 NOTES
+
+Note that this command is not idempotent. L<dh_prep(1)> should be called
+between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
+instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
+
+=head1 EXAMPLES
+
+The examples below lists valid entries for a debian/I<package>.apache2 file. For
+example, the two lines below install a fictional I<mod_foo> Apache module along
+a Debian specific I<.load> file:
+
+ mod src/foo/mod_foo.so
+ mod debian/foo.load
+
+The example below installs a fictional web application called phpmyfoo supplied
+in a package which also supports Lighttpd and nginx:
+
+ conf debian/phpmyfoo.conf lighttpd (>= 1.4.30) | nginx-full
+
+Or, the same example again this time without support for other web servers:
+
+ conf debian/phpmyfoo.conf
+
+As a final example, install a module called I<mod_foo> along with a site
+configuration for a fictional site configuration for the site I<example.com>:
+
+ mod  src/foo/mod_foo.so
+ mod  debian/foo.load
+ mod  debian/foo.conf
+ site debian/example_com.conf

+                Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
+                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
+                interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
+                <b>fully documented in
+                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
+                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
+                found by accessing the <a href="/manual">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
+                package was installed on this server.
+
+          </p>
+          <p>
+                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
+          </p>
+          <pre>
+/etc/apache2/
+|-- apache2.conf
+|       `--  ports.conf
+|-- mods-enabled
+|       |-- *.load
+|       `-- *.conf
+|-- conf-enabled
+|       `-- *.conf
+|-- sites-enabled
+|       `-- *.conf
+          </pre>
+          <ul>
+                        <li>
+                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
+                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
+                           files when starting up the web server.
+                        </li>
+
+                        <li>
+                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
+                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
+                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.

+commands.
+.PP
+.B a2enconf
+is a script that enables the specified configuration file within the

+Likewise,
+.B a2disconf
+disables a specific configuration part by removing those symlinks.  It is not an
+error to enable a configuration which is already enabled, or to disable one which is
+already disabled.
+.PP
+Note that many configuration file may have a dependency to specific modules.
+Unlike module dependencies, these are not resolved automatically. Configuration
+fragments stored in the conf-available directory are considered non-essential or
+being installed and manged by reverse dependencies (e.g. web scripts).
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B \-q, \-\-quiet

+.TP
+.B \-m, \-\-maintmode
+Enables the maintainer mode, that is the program invocation is effectuated
+automatically by a maintainer script. This switch should not be used by end
+users.
+.TP
+.B \-p, \-\-purge
+When disabling a module, purge all traces of the module in the internal state
+data base.
+.SH "EXIT STATUS"
+.B a2enconf
+and

+.SH "SUMMARY"
+.PP
+apache2 is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program\&. It is designed to be run as a standalone daemon process\&. When used like this it will create a pool of child processes or threads to handle requests\&.
+.PP
+In general, apache2 should not be invoked directly, but rather should be
+invoked via /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl\&. The default Debian
+configuration requires environment variables that are defined in
+/etc/apache2/envvars and are not available if apache2 is started directly.
+However, apache2ctl can be used to pass arbitrary arguments to apache2.
+.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
+.PP
+The full documentation is available in the apache2-doc package or at
+http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ . Information about Debian specific changes
+and configuration can be found in
+/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz .
+.SH "OPTIONS"
+.TP
+-d \fIserverroot\fR
+Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to \fIserverroot\fR\&. This can be overridden by the ServerRoot directive in the configuration file\&.
+.TP
+-f \fIconfig\fR
+Uses the directives in the file \fIconfig\fR on startup\&. If \fIconfig\fR does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to the ServerRoot\&. The default is /etc/apache2/apache2\&.conf\&.  
+.TP
+-k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop
+Signals apache2 to start, restart, or stop\&. See Stopping Apache for more information\&.  
+.TP
+-C \fIdirective\fR
+Process the configuration \fIdirective\fR before reading config files\&.  
+.TP
+-c \fIdirective\fR
+Process the configuration \fIdirective\fR after reading config files\&.  
+.TP
+-D \fIparameter\fR
+Sets a configuration \fIparameter \fRwhich can be used with <IfDefine> sections in the configuration files to conditionally skip or process commands at server startup and restart\&.  
+.TP
+-e \fIlevel\fR
+Sets the LogLevel to \fIlevel\fR during server startup\&. This is useful for temporarily increasing the verbosity of the error messages to find problems during startup\&.  
+.TP
+-E \fIfile\fR
+Send error messages during server startup to \fIfile\fR\&.  
+.TP
+-R \fIdirectory\fR
+When the server is compiled using the SHARED_CORE rule, this specifies the \fIdirectory\fR for the shared object files\&.  
+.TP
+-h
+Output a short summary of available command line options\&.  
+.TP
+-l
+Output a list of modules compiled into the server\&. This will \fBnot\fR list dynamically loaded modules included using the LoadModule directive\&.  
+.TP
+-L
+Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and places where the directive is valid\&.  
+.TP
+-M
+Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules\&.  
+.TP
+-S
+Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only shows the virtualhost settings)\&.  
+.TP

+.SH NAME
+apache2ctl \- Apache HTTP server control interface
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+When acting in SysV init mode, apache2ctl takes simple, one-word commands,
+defined below.
+.PP
+.B apachectl 
+.I command
+.PP
+.B apache2ctl 
+.I command
+.PP
+When acting in pass-through mode, apache2ctl can take all the arguments available
+for the httpd binary.
+.PP
+.B apachectl 
+.RI [ httpd-argument ]
+.PP
+.B apache2ctl 
+.RI [ httpd-argument ]
+.PP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B apache2ctl
+is a front end to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
+server.  It is designed to help the administrator control the 
+functioning of the Apache 
+.B apache2
+daemon.  
+.PP
+.B NOTE: 
+The default Debian configuration requires the environment variables
+.BR APACHE_RUN_USER ,
+.BR APACHE_RUN_GROUP ,
+and
+.B APACHE_PID_FILE
+to be set in 
+.BR /etc/apache2/envvars .
+.PP
+The 
+.B apache2ctl
+script returns a 0 exit value on success, and >0 if an error 
+occurs.  For more details, view the comments in the script.
+.PP
+.SH OPTIONS
+The \fIcommand\fP can be any one or more of the following options:
+.TP 14
+.BI start
+Start the Apache daemon.  Gives an error if it is already running.
+.TP
+.BI stop
+Stops the Apache daemon.
+.TP
+.BI restart
+Restarts the Apache daemon by sending it a SIGHUP.  If the daemon
+is not running, it is started.
+This command automatically checks the configuration files via 
+.BI configtest
+before initiating the restart to to catch  the  most obvious  errors.
+However, it is still possible for the daemon to die because of problems
+with the configuration.
+.TP
+.BI fullstatus
+Displays a full status report from 
+.B mod_status. 
+For this to work, you need to have mod_status enabled on your server 
+and a text-based browser such as \fIlynx\fP available on your system.  The
+URL used to access the status report can be set by setting the
+.B APACHE_STATUSURL
+variable in 
+.BR /etc/apache2/envvars .
+.TP
+.BI status
+Displays a brief status report. Similar to the fullstatus option,
+except that the list of requests currently being served is omitted.
+.TP
+.BI graceful
+Gracefully restarts the Apache daemon by sending it a SIGUSR1.  If
+the daemon is not running, it is started.  This differs from a
+normal restart in that currently open connections are not aborted.
+A side effect is that old log files will not be closed immediately.
+This means that if used in a log rotation script, a substantial delay may be
+necessary to ensure that the old log files are closed before processing them.
+This command automatically checks the configuration files via apache2ctl
+configtest before initiating the restart to to catch the most obvious errors.
+However, it is still possible for the daemon to die because of problems with
+the configuration.
+.TP
+.BI graceful-stop
+Gracefully stops the Apache httpd daemon.
+This differs from a normal stop in that currently open connections are not
+aborted.
+A side effect is that old log files will not be closed immediately.
+.TP
+.BI configtest
+Run a configuration file syntax test. It parses the configuration
+files and either reports 
+.B "Syntax Ok"
+or information about the particular syntax error. This test does not catch
+all errors.
+.TP
+.BI help
+Displays a short help message.
+.TP
+The following option was available in earlier versions but has been removed.
+.TP
+.BI startssl
+To start httpd with SSL support, you should edit your configuration file to
+include the relevant directives and then use the normal apache2ctl start.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+The behaviour of
+.B apache2ctl
+can be influenced with these environment variables:
+.BR APACHE_HTTPD ,
+.BR APACHE_LYNX ,
+.BR APACHE_STATUSURL ,
+.BR APACHE_ULIMIT_MAX_FILES ,
+.BR APACHE_RUN_DIR ,
+.BR APACHE_LOCK_DIR ,
+.BR APACHE_RUN_USER ,
+.BR APACHE_ARGUMENTS ,
+.BR APACHE_ENVVARS .
+See the comments in the script for details.
+These variables (except 
+.BR APACHE_ENVVARS )
+can be set in
+.BR /etc/apache2/envvars .

+.SH NAME
+suexec \- Switch User For Exec
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B suexec -V
+.PP
+This is a customized version that can be configured with
+config files in /etc/apache2/suexec.
+.PP
+No other synopsis for usage, because this program
+is otherwise only used internally by the Apache HTTP server.
+.PP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B suexec
+is the "wrapper" support program for the suexec behaviour for the
+Apache HTTP server.  It is run from within the server automatically
+to switch the user when an external program has to be run under a
+different user. For more information about suexec in general, see the online
+document `Apache suexec Support' on the HTTP server project's
+Web site at  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .
+.PP
+This version of suexec reads a config file on every execution. Therefore
+it is a bit slower than the standard suexec version from the apache2-suexec
+package.
+.SH CONFIGURATION
+If suexec is called by a user with name 'username', it will look into
+/etc/apache2/suexec/username for configuration. If the file does not exist,
+suexec will abort. By creating several config files, you can allow several
+different apache run users to use suexec.
+.PP
+The first line in the file is used as the document root (/var/www in the
+standard suexec) and the second line in the file is used as the suffix that is
+appended to users' home directories (public_html in standard suexec).
+.PP
+If any of the lines is commented out (with #), suexec will refuse the
+corresponding type of request. It is recommended to comment out the 
+userdir suffix if you don't need it.
+.SH SECURITY
+Do not set the document root to a path that includes users' home directories
+(like /home or /var) or directories where users can mount removable media.
+Doing so would create local security issues. Suexec does not allow to set the
+document root to the root directory / .
+.SH OPTIONS
+.IP -V
+Display the list of compile-time settings used when \fBsuexec\fP
+was built.  No other action is taken.

-<h3>Summary</h3>
-
-    <p>Some files in the <code>modules/experimental</code> directory
-    under the Apache distribution directory tree are provided as an
-    example to those that wish to write modules that use the Apache
-    API.</p>
-
-    <p>The main file is <code>mod_example.c</code>, which
-    illustrates all the different callback mechanisms and call
-    syntaxes. By no means does an add-on module need to include
-    routines for all of the callbacks - quite the contrary!</p>
-
-    <p>The example module is an actual working module. If you link
-    it into your server, enable the "example-handler" handler for a
-    location, and then browse to that location, you will see a
-    display of some of the tracing the example module did as the
-    various callbacks were made.</p>

-      <li>
-        Run <code class="program"><a href="../programs/configure.html">configure</a></code> with <code>--enable-example</code>

-      <li><code>cp modules/experimental/mod_example.c
-      modules/new_module/<em>mod_myexample.c</em></code></li>

-          <li>Replace the second argument with brief description of your module.
-            It will be used in <code>configure --help</code>.</li>
-          <li>If your module needs additional C compiler flags, linker flags or
-            libraries, add them to CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS accordingly.
-            See other <code>config.m4</code> files in modules directory for
-            examples.</li>
-          <li>Add <code>APACHE_MODPATH_FINISH</code>.</li>
-        </ol>
-      </li>
-
-      <li>Create <code>module/new_module/Makefile.in</code>.
-      If your module doesn't need special build instructions,
-      all you need to have in that file is
-      <code>include $(top_srcdir)/build/special.mk</code>.</li>

-
-    <p>Le fichier principal est <code>mod_example.c</code>, qui
-    constitue une illustration exhaustive des diff้rents m้canismes et
-    syntaxes d'appels. En aucun cas un module additionnel n'aura เ
-    inclure des routines pour tous les appels - il n'en n้cessitera au
-    contraire qu'un petit nombre !</p>
-
-    <p>Le module example fonctionne r้ellement. Si vous le chargez dans
-    votre serveur, activez le gestionnaire "example-handler" dans une
-    section location, et essayez d'acc้der เ la zone du site web
-    correspondante, vous verrez s'afficher certaines sorties que le
-    module example produit au cours des diff้rents appels.</p>

+<h3>Summary</h3>
+
+    <p>The files in the <code>modules/examples</code> directory
+    under the Apache distribution directory tree are provided as an
+    example to those that wish to write modules that use the Apache
+    API.</p>
+
+    <p>The main file is <code>mod_example_hooks.c</code>, which
+    illustrates all the different callback mechanisms and call
+    syntaxes. By no means does an add-on module need to include
+    routines for all of the callbacks - quite the contrary!</p>
+
+    <p>The example module is an actual working module. If you link
+    it into your server, enable the "example-hooks-handler" handler for a
+    location, and then browse to that location, you will see a
+    display of some of the tracing the example module did as the
+    various callbacks were made.</p>

+      <li>
+        Run <code class="program"><a href="../programs/configure.html">configure</a></code> with <code>--enable-example-hooks</code>

+            It will be used in <code>configure --help</code>.</li>
+          <li>If your module needs additional C compiler flags, linker flags or
+            libraries, add them to CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS accordingly.
+            See other <code>config.m4</code> files in modules directory for
+            examples.</li>

+
+      <li>Create <code>module/new_module/Makefile.in</code>.

-      <p>Wouldn't it be nice, while creating a complex web page, if
-      the web browser would automatically refresh the page every
-      time we save a new version from within our editor?
-      Impossible?</p>
-    </dd>
-
-    <dt>Solution:</dt>
-
-    <dd>
-      <p>No! We just combine the MIME multipart feature, the
-      web server NPH feature, and the URL manipulation power of
-      <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code>. First, we establish a new
-      URL feature: Adding just <code>:refresh</code> to any
-      URL causes the 'page' to be refreshed every time it is
-      updated on the filesystem.</p>
-
-<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteRule   ^(/[uge]/[^/]+/?.*):refresh  /internal/cgi/apache/nph-refresh?f=$1</pre>
-
-
-      <p>Now when we reference the URL</p>
-
-<div class="example"><p><code>
-/u/foo/bar/page.html:refresh
-</code></p></div>
-
-      <p>this leads to the internal invocation of the URL</p>
-
-<div class="example"><p><code>
-/internal/cgi/apache/nph-refresh?f=/u/foo/bar/page.html
-</code></p></div>
-
-      <p>The only missing part is the NPH-CGI script. Although
-      one would usually say "left as an exercise to the reader"
-      ;-) I will provide this, too.</p>
